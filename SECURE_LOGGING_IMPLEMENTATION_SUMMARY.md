  - Network data (IP addresses, MAC addresses)
  - URLs with sensitive parameters
  - Database connection strings
- **Recursive object processing** for nested structures
- **Custom pattern support** for domain-specific data
- **Configurable masking options** with strict mode
- **Performance optimized** (sub-millisecond processing)

### 3. 📊 Security Audit Trail (`audit-trail.ts`)
- **Comprehensive event tracking**:
  - Authentication events (attempt, success, failure, refresh)
  - API access events with performance metrics
  - Configuration change tracking
  - Security pattern analysis
- **Brute force detection** (5 attempts in 15 minutes)
- **Critical event alerting** with real-time notifications
- **Event buffering** for batch processing
- **Automatic data sanitization** for all audit events

### 4. 📈 Logging Monitor (`logging-monitor.ts`)
- **Real-time health monitoring** with 30-second intervals
- **Performance metrics tracking**:
  - Average log time: 0.00ms
  - Memory usage monitoring
  - Logs per second calculation
- **Health checks** for all logging components
- **Error tracking** with recent error history
- **Uptime monitoring** and system status
